            <h2>Amazon Reportedly Submits Last-Minute Bid to Acquire TikTok</h2>
            <p><strong>Published on:</strong> March 28, 2025</p>
            
            <p>
                Amazon has submitted a bid to acquire all of TikTok, according to a new report from <i>The New York Times</i>. The last-minute bid comes as TikTok faces an April 5 deadline to shed its Chinese ownership or face a ban in the U.S. However, the parties involved in the deal talks do not appear to be taking Amazon‚Äôs bid seriously, according to <i>The Times</i> report.<br><br>
        
                President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with officials to discuss the app‚Äôs fate on Wednesday. Trump said earlier this week that a deal with TikTok‚Äôs parent company, ByteDance, to sell the app will be finalized before the April 5 deadline.<br><br>
        
                On Tuesday, <i>Financial Times</i> reported that Andreessen Horowitz is in talks to invest in TikTok as part of an Oracle-led bid that includes other American investors interested in purchasing the app.<br><br>
        
                Last week, <i>Reuters</i> reported that private equity firm Blackstone is considering joining ByteDance‚Äôs current non-Chinese shareholders, led by Susquehanna International Group and General Atlantic, in providing fresh capital to bid for TikTok‚Äôs U.S. operations.

            <h2>OpenAI‚Äôs o3 model might be costlier to run than originally estimated</h2>
            <article class="post">
                <img src="your-image.jpg" alt="Article Image" class="post-image">
            
                <p><strong>Published on:</strong> March 28, 2025</p>
                
                <p>
                    When OpenAI unveiled its o3 ‚Äúreasoning‚Äù AI model in December, the company partnered with the creators of ARC-AGI, a benchmark designed to test highly capable AI, to showcase o3‚Äôs capabilities. Months later, the results have been revised, and they now look slightly less impressive than they did initially.<br><br>
            
                    Last week, the Arc Prize Foundation, which maintains and administers ARC-AGI, updated its approximate computing costs for o3. The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, cost around $3,000 to solve a single ARC-AGI problem. Now the Arc Prize Foundation thinks that the cost is much higher ‚Äî possibly around $30,000 per task.<br><br>
            
                    The revision is notable because it illustrates just how expensive today‚Äôs most sophisticated AI models may end up being for certain tasks, at least early on. OpenAI has yet to price o3 ‚Äî or release it, even. But the Arc Prize Foundation believes OpenAI‚Äôs o1-pro model pricing is a reasonable proxy.<br><br>
            
                    For context, o1-pro is OpenAI‚Äôs most expensive model to date.<br><br>
            
                    ‚ÄúWe believe o1-pro is a closer comparison of true o3 cost ‚Ä¶ due to amount of test-time compute used,‚Äù Mike Knoop, one of the co-founders of the Arc Prize Foundation, told TechCrunch. ‚ÄúBut this is still a proxy, and we‚Äôve kept o3 labeled as preview on our leaderboard to reflect the uncertainty until official pricing is announced.‚Äù<br><br>
            
                    A high price for o3 high wouldn‚Äôt be out of the question, given the amount of computing resources the model reportedly uses. According to the Arc Prize Foundation, o3 high used 172x more computing than o3 low, the lowest-computing configuration of o3, to tackle ARC-AGI.<br><br>
            
                    Moreover, rumors have been flying for quite some time about pricey plans OpenAI is considering introducing for enterprise customers. In early March, The Information reported that the company may be planning to charge up to $20,000 per month for specialized AI ‚Äúagents,‚Äù like a software developer agent.<br><br>
            
                    Some might argue that even OpenAI‚Äôs priciest models will cost well under what a typical human contractor or staffer would command. But as AI researcher Toby Ord pointed out in a post on X, the models may not be as efficient. For example, o3 high needed 1,024 attempts at each task in ARC-AGI to achieve its best score.

            <h2>Google fixes Chrome zero-day security flaw used in hacking campaign targeting journalists</h2>
            <p><strong>Published on:</strong> April 4, 2025</p>
            
            <p>
                Google said it has fixed a vulnerability in its Chrome browser for Windows that malicious hackers have used to break into victims‚Äô computers.

In a brief note on Tuesday, Google said that it fixed the vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-2783, that was discovered by researchers at security firm Kaspersky earlier this month. 

Google said it was aware of reports that an exploit for the bug ‚Äúexists in the wild.‚Äù The bug is referred to as a zero-day because the vendor ‚Äî in this case, Google ‚Äî was given no time to fix the bug before it was exploited.

According to Kaspersky, the bug was exploited as part of a hacking campaign targeting Windows computers running Chrome. 

In a blog post, Kaspersky called the campaign ‚ÄúOperation ForumTroll‚Äù and said victims were targeted with a phishing email inviting them to a Russian global political summit. When a link in the email was clicked, victims were taken to a malicious website that immediately exploits the bug to gain access to the victim‚Äôs PC data. 

Kaspersky provided little detail about the bug at the time of the Chrome patch but said that the bug allowed the attackers to bypass Chrome‚Äôs sandbox protections, which limit the browser‚Äôs access to other data on the user‚Äôs computer. Kaspersky said the bug affects all other browsers based on Google‚Äôs Chromium engine.

In a separate analysis, Kaspersky said the bug was likely used in an espionage campaign, typically designed to stealthily monitor and steal data from a target‚Äôs device, usually over a period of time. The Russia-headquartered security firm said the hackers sent personalized phishing emails to Russian media representatives and employees at educational institutions. 

It‚Äôs unclear who was exploiting the bug, but Kaspersky attributed the campaign to a likely state-sponsored or government-backed group of hackers. 

Browsers like Chrome are a frequent target for malicious hackers and government-backed groups. Zero-day bugs capable of breaking through their protections and into the victim‚Äôs sensitive device data can be sold at high prices. In 2024, one zero-day broker was offering up to $3 million for exploitable bugs that can be triggered from over the internet. 

Google said Chrome updates will roll out over the coming days and weeks.
